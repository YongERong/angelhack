## SPLite - To the Moon?

### Project Description

Our project, 'To the Moon?', enables a user to research on a particular financial topic, such as the performance of a stock or a new financial instrument. This is conveyed in the form of a podcast, that can be generated in multiple languages, which aims to break the language barrier for seniors who are unable to read or converse in english. We aim to equip the elderly with information, fostering an understanding of the avenues available to them, and can hence take on investments according to their risk appetite.
